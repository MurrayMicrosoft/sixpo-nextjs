          SIXPO (Sexuality, Inclusion and Exploration) is a festival organized
          by folks with disabilities for their community, where we learn
          together about topics related to sexual wellness. There will be panel

          conversations with peers and experts!{" "}

        </h2>
        <p className="md:mx-[2rem] xl:mx-[5rem] xl:text-xl">
          SIXPO is for folks who are curious or want to learn more about
          sexuality. Whether you have never gone on a date, or you feel like you
          are a sexual expert, SIXpo is for you!

        <p className="md:mx-[2rem] xl:mx-[5rem] xl:text-xl">
          There aren’t many events that celebrate the sexuality of people with
          disabilities. SIXPO is a festival where you can come to learn, ask
          questions, and share your experiences about sexuality. Whether these
          conversations are new to you, or you are confident in talking about
          sexuality, we will have events for you!

          You are your own self-advocate! At SIXPO, you get to choose what you
          want to learn, and you’re always allowed to change your mind! It’s
          okay if you don’t like a workshop, a topic,or a conversation. You can
          leave anytime, and we’ll be happy you took care of yourself! There is
          a Wellness space you can visit if you feel overwhelmed, or want a
          break.
