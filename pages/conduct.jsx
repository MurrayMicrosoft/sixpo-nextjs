          SIXPO, posAbilities, Burnaby Association for Community Inclusion,
          Options for Sexual Health and other SIXPO affiliates (“SIXPO and
          Affiliates”) require all participants, attendees, speakers, guests,
          professionals, press, staff, volunteers and security (“Attendees of
          SIXPO”) to abide by common-sense rules for public behavior and
          personal interaction. SIXPO is a celebration of the sexuality of
          people with disabilities, and any disrespectful or non-consensual
          behavior will not be tolerated in any form. Whenever possible, given
          staffing capacity, SIXPO team members will attempt to address and
          resolve any conflict resulting from disrespectful or non-consensual
          behavior. SIXPO and Affiliates reserve the right to revoke admission
          or participation of Attendees of SIXPO not in compliance with this
          Code of Conduct.
          <br /> <br />
          By attending SIXPO, each Attendee of SIXPO agrees to this Code of
          Conduct.
          <br /> <br />
          Anyone who feels they are in a situation where their safety is
          compromised or who become aware of anyone violating any part of this
          Code of Conduct should locate the nearest SIXPO team member so the
          matter can be handled. SIXPO team members will take prompt action in
          any form they deem appropriate, including immediate expulsion from the
          event. This Code of Conduct applies to all Attendees of SIXPO. If at
          any time you have been made to feel uncomfortable, or if you witness
          another person being harassed, you should contact a SIXPO team member.
          If necessary, we will contact local law enforcement, provide escort,
          offer a safe place or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment.
          We appreciate everyone’s cooperation and understanding in keeping our
          event protected and making it an event that gives individuals and
          groups the confidence to express themselves safely and without
          discrimination.

          educational demonstrations of uses of sex toys and different sexual
          acts for the purposes of the workshops and seminars. If you are
          participating in a workshop that involves demonstrations of sexual
