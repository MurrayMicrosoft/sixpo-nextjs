resource category problem

- tried:
  dynamic routing like with the blog posts

- next idea:
  filter()
  Logic: When resource category button is clicked, resources in category appear

1.  click button
2.  filter through resources by category

possibility: resources.filter(resource => resource.categories.some(category.slug === "crisis"))
